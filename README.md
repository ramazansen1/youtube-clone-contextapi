# Youtube Clone - (React - Context API)

#### by Ramazan Åžen

## Description

This web app is a clone of the site YouTube and is made with React, ContextAPI and the YouTube RapidAPI. On here, you are able to search for videos, watch videos and see the comments for the videos. My goal for this project was to clone YouTube as closely and accurately as possible to showcase my ability to design into a web application.
